## Cryptography, Encryption and Decryption

Cryptography is a php library for encrypting and decrypting login authentication data
### Description

In my quest for a method for creating a login and register page, i came across the almighty question of how to secure said pages and requests to and from the server. I thought of how to authenticate the user and how to authorize said user. My thoughts led me to the creation of this particular type of encryption and decryption.
It uses a private key and encrypts any and all data.
I must confess, creating this was really fun.

Note: i gave my white hat hacker friend an encripted string and asked him to decode it and he couldnt!
